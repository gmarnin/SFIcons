An app to build images in the style of macOS icons. Perfect for your self-service system's catalogue (or at least perfect for mine). 

There are over 6000 macOS icons to chose from. To find the icon name, download the [SF Symbols](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-6.dmg) application from Apple. 

It puts a square with a solid colour and rounded corners and then layers a SFSymbol on top of the square. 

You can either export or share it as a PNG.

### Requirements

macOS 15.0 or later

Built by Adam Anklewicz... well, mostly ChatGPT, but it's a learning experience.

For now, I'd love for you to contribute if you're interested.
